# JJPOTC Servo Chest Opener
Bill of Materials

There are two options to do for the server opener. The first version used a bent end in a loop to hook the chest top plate to pull it down. This works extremely well, but to adjust it is a little cumbersome (since you have to adjust from below the playfield)

Option 2 uses a threaded 2-56 end and a nylon insert nut on top of the chest opener plate. This allows for fine tuning the length from the top.
